In this repository you will find the source code of the tool.

There is no executable as this is an Android application which requires a smartphone with Android 6.0 (API level 23) at least.

In order to run the application on your device download the project using Android Studio, connect your device to your computer and then click on "Run" or SHIFT+F10.
Another method is to just download the application's apk from the following link: https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=E6D61647E9F122BB&resid=E6D61647E9F122BB%21555&authkey=ABF2e9UTxBRypkQ

Move the downloaded APK to your smartphone and then run it. (This will probably require to authorize installation from unknown authors). The application will now be installed.
